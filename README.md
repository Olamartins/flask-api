### Python REST API with Flask

Welcome to the Flask REST API project! This is a simple yet powerful RESTful API built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. 
Whether you're building a backend for a web app, a mobile app, or just exploring APIs, this project is a great starting point.

**Why Build an API**?<br><br>
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software development. They allow different systems to communicate with each other, enabling seamless integration of services, data sharing, and functionality across platforms. By building an API, you're creating a bridge that lets your application interact with the world.

**Features**
- Simple and Lightweight: Built with Flask, this API is easy to understand and extend.

- RESTful Design: Follows REST principles for clean, predictable endpoints.

- CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.

- Easy to Customize: Add new endpoints, modify existing ones, or integrate with databases as needed. <br><br>
